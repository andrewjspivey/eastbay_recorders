    name: "THE DAMN LIARS AT EBR",
    story:
      'Chuck Bradley and The Damn Liars are a traditional country rock band from Sacramento. The quartet has made their mark at large outdoor festivals and small intimate venues, converting the unwashed one show at a time. The band came down to East Bay Recorders to track songs that were ten years in the making. "American Ghost Town" came out in April of 2018. Michael Rosen produced and engineered the sessions. "Super cool traditional country album," Rosen reports. "No samples, all real instruments, great songs."',

    story:
      '"It’s fun when you get to write your history anew and feel safe enough to leave your comfort zone," says producer/engineer Michael Rosen. "The joy for me was to watch somebody step into a different light. He was so happy." Rosen is talking about the Charger recording dates — a new metal influenced punk band fronted by Rancid’s Matt Freeman. Drummer Jason Willer and guitarist Andrew McGee round out the trio. Think Motorhead meets Rancid meets Pantera, Rosen offers. Charger’s debut came out on Pirates Press. The band put down seven songs at East Bay Recorders earlier this year. "It’s super intricate music,” Rosen says, “with lots of changes, stops, and things going on. Plus, we had to make sure you can hear Matt since it’s all about the rhythm section. ”Rosen has worked with Freeman since Rancid’s 1994 release “Let’s Go.” “It was so much fun because when you work in a band like Rancid for so many years, there are a particular set of rules when you do a record,” reports Rosen. “To see somebody who I think is an amazing musician step out and do something, like they’re doing it for the first time with all that joy, was so great.”There are already plans for the trio to get back into the studio for the next set of songs. Stay tuned."',

    name: "THE OLD FIRM CASUALS ARE BACK",
    story:
      "The Old Firm Casuals knocked out a powerful batch of punk rock at East Bay Recorders that will become “Holger Danske,” the band’s second full-length record. Produced by Lars Frederiksen and engineered by Michael Rosen, this collection of songs was recorded with more intensity. “The songwriting and lyrics are a little deeper,” reports Rosen. “Lars is really into Danish folk heroes, and he writes about his Danish heritage on these songs. The band tours a lot and they sound amazing.” The band wanted a particular sound — an old metal record meets a new punk rock record. “We spent a lot of time on it,” Rosen says, “even down to the pacing of the record. We created segues from song to song. It was pretty intricate.” With a semi-serious laugh, Rosen admits that he can’t talk about the guitars used on these songs because he signed an NDA. “We decided to go old school, so we dove deep into the way back machine to pull out guitars that you would never, ever imagine Lars Frederickson playing.”",

    name: "MIXING GBH’S “MOMENTUM”",
    story:
      "Michael Rosen teamed up with Lars Frederiksen to mix the latest offering from GBH titled “Momentum.” Epitaph released the record in November of 2017. “It was a new school project where they sent me the files, and I’d mix them here, then send Lars an MP3 for notes, then send an MP3 to the band,” Rosen says. Singer Colin Abrahall told Heavy: “We laid down all kinds of takes on the songs which made the mixing interesting as we’d send it all off to Michael (Rosen – Engineer) and him and Lars (Fredericksen – Rancid) would send back tracks. You’d think something was maybe a glitch or whatever and it’d come back, and we’d listen and think ‘that’s f*cking amazing’!”",

    story:
      "Producer Matthew Kaufman brought alt-rocker Matt Jaffe into East Bay Recorders to get down tracks for the singer/songwriters “California’s Burning” release. Engineered by Michael Rosen, the dates were filled with cool moments that kept the entire team on their toes. “Matthew is a first take producer, which is old school and cool,” Rosen recalls. “He’s got this trick where he makes the drummer play without cymbals on the first run. Then we’d go back and overdub the crashes and other stuff. It kept the tracks super clean. I don’t do that with anybody else, so that’s interesting.” “California’s Burning” came out on September 14, 2018",

    name: "WORKING WITH A LEGEND",
    story:
      "Country Joe McDonald is a folk icon, producing generational defining songs like “I Feel Like I’m Fixing to Die Rag” and legendary performances at Woodstock (the original) and Monterey Pop Festival. McDonald came into East Bay Recorders to lay down a handful of acoustic tracks. “It was just him singing and playing,” producer/engineer Michael Rosen recalls. “His manager flipped and said that we had to make a record out of those sessions. ”Rosen took on the challenge, bringing in a couple of his trusted session players — drummer Prairie Prince and guitarist James DePrato. Bassist Blair Hardman and the Bright Light Quartet also contributed. The sessions became Joe’s latest offering, “50.” “He’s fantastic. He knows exactly what he wants. He can still sing and play,” Rosen says. “You hear that voice, and you’re immediately transported back to Woodstock and the FU (“I Feel Like I’m Fixing to Die”) song.” The acoustic dates were straight ahead singer and guitar. Adding the band to those tracks were a blend of sessions at East Bay Recorders and virtual dates where Rosen sent tracks to players who recorded their performance and then he added it to the mix. Joe, Rosen says, was interested in experimenting and finding a way to make a song cool. “His attitude was, ‘If it doesn’t sound right then don’t do it.’ He had no problem with flipping stuff up. In one verse we dropped the drums out. He’s like, ‘Why not?’ “It was cool to try something different and go in another direction,” Rosen continues. “It keeps it green for me, and it was exactly what he wanted to get down.” Following the release of “50,” Country Joe is appearing at Woodstock 50 on August 17, 2019.",
