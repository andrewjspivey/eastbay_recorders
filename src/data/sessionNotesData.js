THIS RECORD WAS ALSO A LITTLE DIFFERENT BECAUSE TERRY WROTE A BUNCH OF THE SONGS ON THIS RECORD.”  — MICHAEL ROSEN",

IN A GREAT BIG ROOM SET IN THE MIDDLE OF A PECAN RANCH. IT WAS ALSO ABOUT 500 FEET FROM THE MEXICAN BORDER. WE COULD LITERALLY SEE ILLEGAL ALIENS SNEAKING ACROSS INTO THE US AND SEE THE BORDER PATROL LOOKING FOR THEM. THIS RECORD WAS KIND OF A THROWBACK BECAUSE WE DID THE ENTIRE RECORD ANALOG. NO PRO TOOLS. ALL OLD SCHOOL TAPE. LONG DAYS IN A DUSTY, BORING, BUT BEAUTIFUL PLACE. WE ALSO FOUND A BRITISH KID NAMED DEAN THAT WE TOOK HOME WITH US. HE’S NOW TESLA’S TOUR MANAGER AND LIVES IN SACRAMENTO.”  — MICHAEL ROSEN",

WE LIVED IN THE MANSION AND RECORDED IN THIS HUGE BALLROOM. I DON’T THINK WE EVER LEFT THE HOUSE IN SIX WEEKS. WE COOKED THERE OURSELVES, WORKED OUT AND RECORDED EVERY DAY. WE HAD TONS OF PARTIES AND CAME UP WITH A GREAT RECORD. ON A PERSONALLY SAD NOTE, WHILE WE WERE THERE, A DEAR FRIEND OF MINE TOLD ME HE HAD BRAIN CANCER AND WAS NOT GOING TO MAKE IT. RIGHT AFTER HE TOLD ME WE WERE WORKING ON A SONG CALLED “WHAT DO YOU DO?” THAT JUST MADE ME START CRYING FOR MY FRIEND BECAUSE OF THE LYRICS.”  — MICHAEL ROSEN",

I DON’T EVEN KNOW IF THE KID KNEW HOW TO PLAY THE PIANO, BUT WE SPENT QUITE A WHILE RECORDING HIM. THE RECORD WAS DONE AT STUDIO 880.”  — MICHAEL ROSEN",

THE COOL THING THAT HAPPENED WHILE WE WERE MAKING THIS RECORD IS THAT WE WENT TO WORK AT ELECTRIC LADY STUDIOS IN NEW YORK TO FINISH DOING OVERDUBS. WHILE WE WERE WORKING, WE FOUND OUT THE LEGENDARY PUNK ROCKER/AUTHOR JIM CARROLL WAS UPSTAIRS DOING AN INTERVIEW FOR “THE BASKETBALL DIARIES” MOVIE, WHICH HAD JUST BEEN RELEASED. SO, WE ASKED HIM TO DO SOMETHING ON THE RECORD. HE SAID HE WOULD FOR SOME RECORDS THAT HE COULD SELL FOR SMOKES. HE LISTENED TO THE SONG “JUNKIE MAN” TWICE, WROTE DOWN THE RAP THAT’S IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SONG AND THEN WENT OUT TO THE MIC. WE RECORDED IT IN ONE TAKE. HE DROPPED THE LEGAL PAD WITH THE LYRICS, GOT HIS RECORDS AND WALKED OUT. AND THAT’S HOW THE RECORD CAME TO BE CALLED “OUT COME THE WOLVES,” BECAUSE HE USED THAT PHRASE IN HIS RAP.”  — MICHAEL ROSEN",

At one point they invited us in to have a listen to what they were working on. Brett Gurewitz, who was producing, and Lars decided to freak them out, so they both stripped down to their boxers and boots. Both of those dudes are covered in tattoos. They walked into Studio B, sat down and hit play on the playback. The Muffs and Rob played a bunch of stuff back and never said one word about them not being dressed. Brett and Lars listened got up and walked out. Done.”  — Michael Rosen",

THE OTHER SPECIAL THING WAS THAT THE ENTIRE RECORD WAS DONE LIVE IN THE STUDIO. ON CERTAIN SONGS, I HAD OVER 45 PEOPLE RECORDING AT ONCE, INCLUDING TODD DOING LEAD VOCALS. THERE WERE BACKGROUND SINGERS, STRING SECTIONS AND HORN SECTIONS. EVERY TIME SOMEBODY NEW WALKED INTO THE STUDIO, TODD GAVE THEM SOMETHING TO PLAY — TAMBOURINES, SHAKERS, ANYTHING HE COULD THINK OF.” — MICHAEL ROSEN',
