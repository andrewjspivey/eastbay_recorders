        “WE DID THIS RECORD WITH TERRY THOMAS, THE GUY THAT PRODUCED “BUST A
        NUT.” IT WAS A TOUGH RECORD TO MAKE BECAUSE THE BAND DID NOT HAVE THE
        SONGS TOGETHER AND WERE VERY SCATTERED DOING A LIVE DVD AND A BUNCH OF
        OTHER PERSONAL MATTERS. THIS RECORD WAS ALSO A LITTLE DIFFERENT BECAUSE
        TERRY WROTE A BUNCH OF THE SONGS ON THIS RECORD.” — MICHAEL ROSEN

        “A CRAZY RECORD, BECAUSE WE WENT A LIVED IN A RESIDENTIAL STUDIO ABOUT
        30 MINUTES SOUTH OF EL PASO, TEXAS CALLED SONIC RANCH. A BEAUTIFUL
        STUDIO WITH EVERY PIECE OF GEAR YOU’D EVER WANT. IN A GREAT BIG ROOM SET
        IN THE MIDDLE OF A PECAN RANCH. IT WAS ALSO ABOUT 500 FEET FROM THE
        MEXICAN BORDER. WE COULD LITERALLY SEE ILLEGAL ALIENS SNEAKING ACROSS
        INTO THE US AND SEE THE BORDER PATROL LOOKING FOR THEM. THIS RECORD WAS
        KIND OF A THROWBACK BECAUSE WE DID THE ENTIRE RECORD ANALOG. NO PRO
        TOOLS. ALL OLD SCHOOL TAPE. LONG DAYS IN A DUSTY, BORING, BUT BEAUTIFUL
        PLACE. WE ALSO FOUND A BRITISH KID NAMED DEAN THAT WE TOOK HOME WITH US.
        HE’S NOW TESLA’S TOUR MANAGER AND LIVES IN SACRAMENTO.” — MICHAEL ROSEN

        “A GREAT, GREAT EXPERIENCE DOING THIS RECORD. WE RENTED AN AMAZING
        MANSION IN LA WHERE THEY DID THE “ROCK STAR: SUPERNOVA” REALITY SHOW, AS
        WELL AS TONS OF OTHER REALITY SHOWS. WE LIVED IN THE MANSION AND
        RECORDED IN THIS HUGE BALLROOM. I DON’T THINK WE EVER LEFT THE HOUSE IN
        SIX WEEKS. WE COOKED THERE OURSELVES, WORKED OUT AND RECORDED EVERY DAY.
        WE HAD TONS OF PARTIES AND CAME UP WITH A GREAT RECORD. ON A PERSONALLY
        SAD NOTE, WHILE WE WERE THERE, A DEAR FRIEND OF MINE TOLD ME HE HAD
        BRAIN CANCER AND WAS NOT GOING TO MAKE IT. RIGHT AFTER HE TOLD ME WE
        WERE WORKING ON A SONG CALLED “WHAT DO YOU DO?” THAT JUST MADE ME START
        CRYING FOR MY FRIEND BECAUSE OF THE LYRICS.” — MICHAEL ROSEN

        “WE DID MOST OF THE RECORD AT FANTASY STUDIOS. WE TOOK ABOUT SIX WEEKS
        TO DO EVERYTHING. WE RECORDED A TOTAL OF 45 SONGS FOR THE RECORD AND 22
        MADE THE FINAL CUT. THE COOL THING THAT HAPPENED WHILE WE WERE MAKING
        THIS RECORD IS THAT WE WENT TO WORK AT ELECTRIC LADY STUDIOS IN NEW YORK
        TO FINISH DOING OVERDUBS. WHILE WE WERE WORKING, WE FOUND OUT THE
        LEGENDARY PUNK ROCKER/AUTHOR JIM CARROLL WAS UPSTAIRS DOING AN INTERVIEW
        FOR “THE BASKETBALL DIARIES” MOVIE, WHICH HAD JUST BEEN RELEASED. SO, WE
        ASKED HIM TO DO SOMETHING ON THE RECORD. HE SAID HE WOULD FOR SOME
        RECORDS THAT HE COULD SELL FOR SMOKES. HE LISTENED TO THE SONG “JUNKIE
        MAN” TWICE, WROTE DOWN THE RAP THAT’S IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SONG AND THEN
        WENT OUT TO THE MIC. WE RECORDED IT IN ONE TAKE. HE DROPPED THE LEGAL
        PAD WITH THE LYRICS, GOT HIS RECORDS AND WALKED OUT. AND THAT’S HOW THE
        RECORD CAME TO BE CALLED “OUT COME THE WOLVES,” BECAUSE HE USED THAT
        PHRASE IN HIS RAP.” — MICHAEL ROSEN

        “We did the whole record in about eight days. We were working in Studio
        A at Fantasy Studios. The Muffs we working on a new record with producer
        Rob Cavallo in Studio B. At one point they invited us in to have a
        listen to what they were working on. Brett Gurewitz, who was producing,
        and Lars decided to freak them out, so they both stripped down to their
        boxers and boots. Both of those dudes are covered in tattoos. They
        walked into Studio B, sat down and hit play on the playback. The Muffs
        and Rob played a bunch of stuff back and never said one word about them
        not being dressed. Brett and Lars listened got up and walked out. Done.”

        TO GET TO WORK WITH HIM WAS AN UNREAL THING. THE OTHER SPECIAL THING WAS
        THAT THE ENTIRE RECORD WAS DONE LIVE IN THE STUDIO. ON CERTAIN SONGS, I
        HAD OVER 45 PEOPLE RECORDING AT ONCE, INCLUDING TODD DOING LEAD VOCALS.
        THERE WERE BACKGROUND SINGERS, STRING SECTIONS AND HORN SECTIONS. EVERY
        TIME SOMEBODY NEW WALKED INTO THE STUDIO, TODD GAVE THEM SOMETHING TO
        PLAY — TAMBOURINES, SHAKERS, ANYTHING HE COULD THINK OF.” — MICHAEL
