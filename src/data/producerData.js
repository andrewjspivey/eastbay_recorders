    story:
      "Kevin began playing bass when he was 11 years old, had his first professional gig at the age of 14 and has been on the road, on the stage, or in the studio since. Early in his career, he was a member of the House of Blues house band in Cambridge, Mass. where he cut his teeth playing behind a Who’s Who of legends that included Bo Diddley, Susan Tedeschi, Ronnie Earl, David Maxwell, Joe Walsh, Peter Wolf and others.   In the late ‘90s, Kevin relocated to San Francisco and was sucked up into the local scene playing with a dizzying array of artists until he caught the gig playing behind Shelby Lynne supporting her debut record. He soon found himself criss-crossing the globe highlighted by an appearance on the “Jools Holland Show” in London.   During this time, Kevin was also a first-call bassist for Will Porter and the California All Stars. While with Will Porter, Kevin played with GRAMMY winners Al Wilson (“Show and Tell”) and Billy Preston as well as soul legend Barbara Lewis (“Hello, Stranger”), The Coasters, and The Drifters.   In 2004, former Counting Crows drummer Steve Bowman recommended Kevin to be the bass player for Chuck Prophet and The Mission Express, with whom Kevin currently plays.   In 2008, Kevin appeared with Chuck and band on “The Late Show with David Letterman” and “Last Call with Carson Daly.” His television credits also include an appearance on Mexican TV as a performer in Peter Buck’s 2013 “Todos Santos Festival,” and he’s been a part of four “Mountain Stage” radio broadcasts and performed on NPR’s “Morning Edition.”   Kevin has also toured the U.S. with New Orleans guitarists Papa Mali and John Mooney, blues artists Chris Cain and James Armstrong, rock band Luce, Nashville recording act The Bittersweets, and singer/songwriter Essence.  He’s appeared on stage with John Doe, Charlie Sexton, Jon Langford, Kelly Willis, Henry Butler, Earl Thomas, The Mastersons, Peter Case, Peter Buck, Alejandro Escovedo, Noelle Hampton and Beth Waters.",
